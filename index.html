<p>About Me</p>
Hello all, my name is Bianca Chery. I am originally from Fort. Lauderdale, 
Florida by way of Tennessee. I now reside in North Carolina. I am a 32 year young woman with goofy,
kid tendencies (basically I'm a big kid). I have four beautiful babies who are the very existence of 
my life. I am a proud alum of Thee Illustrious Tennessee State University, which I attended for a 
Bachelor's Degree in Social Work. I've done a plethora of different kinds of jobs, but my favorite 
of all time was being a security officer. My goals out of life are to be happy within myself, become 
financially free and leave something for my kids to be proud about. Thank you all for your inquiry into me, 
have the day that you deserve.
